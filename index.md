title: Cleaning Windows
---

I'm playing in the sandbox, checking out Github as a host for a blog. I have Uncorrected, which is hosted via Wordpress. I like this setup a lot on my Mac, but the best way to post from Windows to Wordpress is, oddly, Microsoft Word. I want something a little more grungy. Lifelong Mac user shaking his tree for fun.
